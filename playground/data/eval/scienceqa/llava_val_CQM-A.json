He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenneth put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nShawn was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Shawn put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Shawn's test show?\nA. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour"

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDakota was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Dakota wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well.\nSo, Dakota put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards.\nFigure: a drone without blade guards.\nWhich of the following could Dakota's test show?\nA. if the blade guards would break in a crash\nB. how much the drone weighed with the blade guards\nC. if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly"

The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Manuel thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music.

Tendons connect muscle to bone. When a muscle contracts, the tendon transmits the force created by the muscle to the bone, causing it to move. Ligaments, meanwhile, connect bones to one another.

Zoe was a bioengineer who wanted to increase the amount of insulin that the bacteria produced by 20%. She read that giving the bacteria more nutrients could affect the amount of insulin they produced. So, Zoe gave extra nutrients to some of the bacteria. Then, she measured how much insulin those bacteria produced compared to bacteria that did not get extra nutrients.\nFigure: studying bacteria in a laboratory.\nWhich of the following could Zoe's test show?\nA. whether producing more insulin would help the bacteria grow faster\nB. whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin\nC. whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin"

To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nWhich of the following could Luna and Alexandra's test show?\nA. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry\nB. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use"

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gabriel put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Gabriel's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nC. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour"

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nMarshall was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Marshall put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Marshall's test show?\nA. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour"

Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.\nFor example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.\nSloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.\nHanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world.\nBased on the text, how does a sloth's fur help protect it?\nA. A sloth's fur helps it dry off quickly.\nB. A sloth's fur protects its important organs.\nC. A sloth's fur helps it cling to tree branches."

The first plants to reappear are pioneer species, weeds and hardy plants that grow quickly and can survive in poor or limited soil. As succession continues, larger plants like bushes and then evergreens take hold. These are plants that need open sunlight to grow. After many years, the forest will reach its final stage, called a climax community. In temperate climates, this community is usually a mature forest of deciduous, hardwood trees, which lose their leaves in the winter. At this stage, the forest is stable, at least until the next fire starts the process over again.\nWhich term matches the picture?\nA. climax community\nB. pioneer species"

To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nWhich of the following could Marie and Janelle's test show?\nA. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry\nB. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use"

The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Hunter thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\nWhich of the following could Hunter's test show?\nA. if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second\nB. how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water\nC. how much athletes would sweat in the fabric"

About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.\nOne of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.\nBeetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what.\nFinally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time. Beetles quickly notice temperature changes in their environment. So, they can quickly respond by migrating to a warmer place. No wonder there are so many beetles in the world. They have what it takes to stay alive.\nBased on clues in the text, how did fossil evidence help scientists explain the huge number of beetle species?\nA. It helped scientists learn that beetle species only appeared after Earth's most recent ice age.\nB. It helped scientists figure out which ancient animal species were most likely to eat beetles.\nC. It let scientists compare ancient beetles' wing structure to modern beetles' wing structure.\nD. It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nBrett, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Brett thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\nWhich of the following could Brett's test show?\nA. how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water\nB. how much athletes would sweat in the fabric\nC. if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second"

This movement is called diffusion. If you spray air freshener or perfume in a room, the perfume molecules will tend to move toward areas in which they are less concentrated, which is how the scent spreads.\nOsmosis is the term for a related but more specific kind of movement, the movement of certain kinds of molecules across semipermeable (semi-open) membranes. Many substances can't move across semipermeable cell membranes, but water molecules can. The process of pickling vegetables involves osmosis. Salt is more highly concentrated in salt water than it is in vegetables. For this reason, when a vegetable is placed in a jar of salt water, water molecules will pass via osmosis from areas of lower salt concentration (inside of the vegetable cells) to areas of higher salt concentration (the salt water surrounding the vegetables). This leaves the vegetables crispier.\nWhich term matches the picture?\nA. osmosis\nB. diffusion"

The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40\u00b0C. Darnel wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50\u00b0C with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00b0C.\nFigure: a weather station.\nWhich of the following could Darnel's test show?\nA. how well the weather station would work when it was windy\nB. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00b0C"

If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Albert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRaymond was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Raymond put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nWhich of the following could Raymond's test show?\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour"

She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Ann wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well.\nSo, Ann put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards.\nFigure: a drone without blade guards.\nWhich of the following could Ann's test show?\nA. if the blade guards would break in a crash\nB. how much the drone weighed with the blade guards\nC. if adding the blade guards made the drone fly poorly"

The tiny rooms are shaped like hexagons. That means they have six sides. These hexagons fit together without wasting space, and their shape helps make the nest stronger.\nTo make the wax for the honeycombs, bees use the sugar from the honey they eat. They convert this sugar into wax. To make the honeycomb rooms, bees first make a circle with the soft wax. They then use their bodies to push the circle and give it its six flat sides. Once the rooms have been built, the bees use them to store pollen, eggs, and honey. All of those are things that bees need to keep growing and working day after day.\nWhat are the small rooms inside the bees' nest made of?\nA. eggs\nB. sticks\nC. wax"

After the fabric dried, Mona scored the darkness of the squares on a scale from light to dark. She compared the darkness of the linen fabric to the darkness of the cotton fabric.\nFigure: fabric that has been dyed black.\nIdentify the question that Mona's experiment can best answer.\nA. Does linen fabric turn darker than cotton fabric when soaked in a mixture of black dye and water?\nB. Does fabric turn darker when soaked in a mixture of black dye and water for 15 minutes compared to 30 minutes?"

Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.\nIn a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles.

        "value": "<image>\nContext: Read the text about okapis.\nWhen you first see an okapi, you might think it's related to a horse or a zebra. Its body and neck are horse-like, and its legs have black-and-white stripes like a zebra does. But the okapi is not related to a horse or a zebra; its closest relative is actually the giraffe. In fact, okapis are sometimes called forest giraffes, since they live mainly in the rain forests of central Africa.\nAn okapi's relationship to a giraffe is most noticeable in its face. Like giraffes, okapis have long, thin faces topped with large, upward-pointing ears. Male okapis also have little furry horns like giraffes' horns. Additionally, both giraffes and okapis have long, dark tongues, which can grab and strip leaves from trees. And just like giraffes, okapis are plant eaters, feeding on leaves, buds, twigs, and fruit.\nIn many ways, though, okapis are quite different from their giraffe cousins. An okapi's neck is much shorter than a giraffe's. This is useful, because a long neck would make it difficult to move through thick vegetation. Another important difference is that giraffes are social and live in herds, while okapis are shy, solitary creatures. They tend to live alone, hiding in the dense forest. Perhaps that's why most people didn't even know okapis existed until around 1900.\nEven though okapis tend to keep to themselves, they do have ways to communicate with each other. For example, they mark their territories by leaving scent marks with their feet. And mother okapis can communicate with their babies \"silently,\" using sounds that are too low in pitch for people\u2014and predators\u2014to hear. That's a good thing, too, as these animals are in danger of dying out. They need all the protection from predators that they can get.\nBased on the text, why are okapis sometimes referred to as forest giraffes?\nA. They are a type of giraffe that sometimes migrates to the rain forest.\nB. Their giraffe-like markings help them blend in with their forest homes.\nC. They have long necks like giraffes do, and they eat leaves in forests.\nD. They are related to giraffes, and they live in central African rain forests."

Then, the males mate with multiple females. After a male mates with a female, she lays eggs in the male's nest and then leaves. The male guards his nest until the eggs hatch. As he guards the nest, he waves his fins near the eggs for short periods of time.
